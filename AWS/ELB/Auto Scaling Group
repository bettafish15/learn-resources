Auto-scaling:
	+ scale out (add ec2 instances) to match an increased load
	+ scale in (remove EC2 instances) to match an decreased load
	+ ensure a minimum and maximum number of ec2 running
	+ automatically register ec2 instances to load balancer
	+ recreate an ec2 instance in case a previous one is terminated (ex: if unhealthy)
	+ free (only pay for underlying ec2 instances)

- auto scaling group attributes:
	+ a launch template:
		- AMI + InstanceType
		- EC2 User Data
		- EBS Volumes
		- Security Groups
		- SSH Key Pair
		- IAM Roles for EC2
		- Network + Subnets Information
		- Load Balancer Info
	+ min size/max size/ initial capacity
	+ scaling policies

Scaling policies:
	- Dynamic scaling:
		+ target tracking: I want average ASG CPU to stay at around 40%
		+ simple/step scaling: when a cloudwatch alarm is triggered (CPU > 70%) add 2 units
		+ scheduled scaling: increase the min capacity to 10 at 5pm on Fridays
	- Predictive scaling:
		+ AI
