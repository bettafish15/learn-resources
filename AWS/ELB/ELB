4 kinds of load balancer:
	+ classic load balancer (v1 - old generation): year 2009 - CLB - HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, SSL 
	+ application load balancer (v2 - new generation): year 2016 - ALB - HTTP, HTTPS, Websocket
	+ Network load balancer (v2 - new generation): year 2017 - NLB - TCP, TLS , udp
	+ Gateway Load Balancer - 2020 - GWLB - layer 3 network layer ip protocol

the NLB supports HTTP health checks as well as TCP and HTTPS


Gateway Load Balancer: uses the GENEVE protocol on port 6081

Cross zone load balancing: 
	+ only application load balancer is enabled by default.
	+ inter AZ data is free


Connection draining - deregistration delay
	- time to complete 'in-flight requests' while the instance is de-registering or unhealthy

Only Network Load Balancer provides both static DNS name and static IP. 
While, Application Load Balancer provides a static DNS name but it does NOT provide a static IP. 
The reason being that AWS wants your Elastic Load Balancer to be accessible using a static endpoint, 
even if the underlying infrastructure that AWS manages changes.

When you enable ELB Health Checks, your ELB won't send traffic to unhealthy (crashed) EC2 instances.
