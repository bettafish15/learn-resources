App load balancer:
	- latency ~ 400 ms
	- layer 7 (http)
	- load balance to multiple HTTP apps across machines (target groups)
	- load balance to multiple apps on the same machine (containers)
	- supports http/2 and websocket
	- supports redirects (from http to https for ex)

	- routing tables to different target groups:
		- routing based on path URL
		- routing based on hostname (one.example.com & other.example.com)
		- routing based on query string, headers

	- ALB are great fit for micro-services & container-based app (docker & amazon ECS)
	- port mapping feature to redirect to a dynamic port
	- can route to multiple target groups
	- health checks are at the target group level
	- fixed hostname (XXX.region.elb.amazonaws.com)
	- application see IP through header X-Forwarded-For
	- X-Forwarded-Port, X-Forwarded-Proto

Target groups:
	_ EC2 instances (can be managed by auto scaling group) - http
	- ECS Tasks (managed by ECS) - HTTP
	- Lambda functions
	- IP Addresses - must be private IPs
