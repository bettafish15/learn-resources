Lambda by default:
	+ By default, Lambda function is launched outside of VPC
	=> cannot access resources in VPC (RDS, ElasticCache, internal ELB...)

Lambda in VPC:
	+ must define VPC ID, subnets and security groups
	=> lambda will create an ENI in your subnet

Lambda with RDS Proxy:
	+ If lambda func directly access database => open too many connections under high load
	+ RDS Proxy:
		- improve scalability by pooling and sharing DB connections
		- improve avail by reducing 66% the failover time and preserving conn
		- improve secur by enforcing IAM authen and storing creds in secrets manager

	*** Lambda func must in VPC, RDS Proxy NEVER PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE
