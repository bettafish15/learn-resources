Cloudfront:
	+ CDN (see CDN => cloudfront)
	+ improves read perf, content is cached at the edge
	+ improves users experience
	+ 216 point of presence globally (edge locations)
	+ ddos protection (because worldwide), integration with Shield, AWS Web App Firewall

Cloudfront - Origins:
	+ S3 Bucket:
		- for distributing files and caching them at the edge
		- enhanced security with cloudfront origin access control (OAC)
		- OAC is replacing ORigin Access Identity (OAI)
		- cloudfront can be used as an ingress (to upload files to S3)

	+ Custom origin (HTTP)
		- App load balancer
		- Ec2 instance
		- s3 website (must first enable bucket as a static S3 website)
		- any http backend

Cloudfront vs S3 Cross Region Replication:
	+ CloudFront:
		- Global Edge network
		- File is cached for a TTL (maybe a day)
		- Greate for static content that must be avail everywhere

	+ S3 Cross Region Replication:
		- Must be setup for each region you want replication to happen
		- Files are updated in near real-time
		- Read only
		- Greate for dynamic content that needs to be avail at low-latency in few regions
