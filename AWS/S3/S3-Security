Object Encryption:
	+ Server-Side Encryption (SSE):
		- Server-Side Encryption with Amazon S3-Managed Keys (SSE-S3) - Enabled by default
			. Encryption type is AES-256
			. Must set header "x-amz-server-side-encryption": "AES256"
			. Enabled by default for new buckets & new objects

		- Server-Side Encryption with KMS Keys stored in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS)
			. because using KMS => user control + audit key usage using CloudTrail
			. Must set header "x-amz-server-side-encryption": "aws:kms"
			. impacted by KMS limits (upload => calls GenerateDataKey KMS API 
									- download => Decrypt KMS API)
			. KMS quota per sec (5500, 10000, 30000 req/s based on region) - can request a quota 
				increase using Service Quotas Console
		- Server-SIde Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C)
			. S3 does NOT store the encryption key you provide
			. HTTPS must be used
			. encryption key must provided in HTTP headers for every HTTP request made
	+ Client-Side Encryption:
			. use client libraries such as Amazon S3 Client-Side Encryption Library
			. must encrypt data before sending and decrypt after retrieving

Encryption in transit (SSL/TLS)
	+ HTTPS is recommended
	+ HTTPS is mandatory for SSE-C

CORS:
	+ if a client makes a cross-origin request on our S3 - Bucket, we need to enable correct CORS headers

MFA Delete:
	+ Versioning must be enabled
	+ Only the bucket owner (root account) can enable/disable MFA Delete
	+ MFA will be required to: 
		. Permanently delete an object version
		. SuspendVersioning on the bucket
	+ MFA won't be required to:
		. Enable Versioning
		. List deleted versions

S3 Access Logs:
	+ For audit purpose, you may want to log all access to S3 buckets
	+ any request made to S3, from any acc, authorized or denied, will be logged into another S3 buckets
	+ that data can be analyzed using data analysis tools...
	+ the target logging bucket must be in the same AWS Region

	*** Do not set your logging bucket to be the monitored bucket 
		=> logging loop, bucket will grow exponentially
