S3 Standard - General Purpose:
	+ 99.99% Avail
	+ sustain 2 concurrent facility failures
	+ low latency, high throughput
S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (IA):
	+ lower cost than s3 standard
	+ for data is less frequently accessed, but requires rapid access when needed => incur a cost when retrieve
	+ 99.9% avail
S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access
	+ lower cost than s3 standard
	+ for data is less frequently accessed, but requires rapid access when needed => incur a cost when retrieve
	+ durability: 99.999999999% in a single AZ; data lost when AZ is destroyed
	+ 99.5% avail
S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval:
	+ low-cost object storage meant for archiving / backup
	+ pricing: storage + object retreval cost\
	+ millisecond retreval
	+ minimum storage duration of 90 days (see *)
S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval:
	+ low-cost object storage meant for archiving / backup
	+ pricing: storage + object retreval cost
	+ three flexibility retrieval time: expedited (1 to 5 mins), Standard (3 to 5 hours), 
		Bulk (5 to 12 hours) - free
S3 Glacier Deep Archive:
	+ low-cost object storage meant for archiving / backup
	+ pricing: storage + object retreval cost
	+ retrieval time: Standard (12 hours), Bulk (48 hours)
	+ Minimum storage duration of 180 days
S3 Intelligent Tiering:
	+ Small monthly monitoring and auto-tiering fee
	+ moves objects automatically between access Tiers based on usage
	+ there are no retreval charges in S3 Intelligent-Tiering
		- Frequent Access Tier (automatic): default tier
		- Infrequent Access Tier (automatic): objects not access for 30 days
		- Archive Instant Access Tier (automatic): objects not access for 90 days
		- Archive Access Tier (optional): configurable from 90-700+ days
		- Deep Archive Access Tier (optional): configurable from 180-700+ days

- can move between classes manually or using S3 lifecycle config

S3 Durability and Avail:
	+ Durability: 
		- High durability (99,999999999%, 11 9's) of objects across multiple AZ
			=> 10,000,000 objects with S3, average expect to incur a loss of a single object once
			every 10.000 years
		- same for all storage classes

	+ Avail:
		- measures how readily avail a service is
		- Standard has 99.99% avail = not avail 53 mins a year





*************************
* S3 Intelligent-Tiering, S3 Standard-IA, and S3 One Zone-IA storage are charged for a minimum storage duration of 
30 days, and objects deleted before 30 days incur a pro-rated charge equal to the storage charge for the remaining 
days. Objects that are deleted, overwritten, or transitioned to a different storage class before 30 days will incur
the normal storage usage charge plus a pro-rated request charge for the remainder of the 30-day minimum. 
This includes objects that are deleted as a result of file operations performed by File Gateway. 
Objects stored for 30 days or longer will not incur a 30-day minimum request charge.
