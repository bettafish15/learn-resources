S3 - Baseline Performance
	+ Amazon S3 automatically scales to high request rates, latency 100-200 ms
	+ at least 3500 PUT/COPY/POST/DELETE or 5500 GET/HEAD requests per sec per prefix in a bucket

	+ Multi-Part upload:
		- recommended for files > 100MB, must use for files > 5GB
		- can help parallelize upoads (speed up transfers)

	+ S3 Transfer Acceleration:
		- increase transfer speed by transferring file to an AWS edge location which will forward data
			to the S3 bucket in the target region
		- Compatible with multi-part upload

S3 Byte-Range Fetches:
	+ Parallelize GETs by requesting specific byte ranges
	+ Better resilience in case of failures
	+ can be used to speed up downloads
	+ can be used to retrieve only partial data (eg: head of a file)
