Aurora: not open-source
	supports MySQL and Postgres drivers. 
	claimed to be 3x perf over postgres and 5x perf over MySQL
	able to restore to any point of time without using backups

	+ automatically grow storage in increments of 10GB, up to 128 TB
	+ up to 15 replicas, replication is sub 10 ms replica lag
	+ failover in Aurora is instantaneous (High Availability native)
	+ 20% more cost than RDS

High Avail and Read Scaling:
	+ 6 copies of data across 3 AZ:
		+ 4 copies out of 6 needed for writes
		+ 3 copies out of 6 need for reads
		+ self healing with peer-to-peer replication
		+ storage is spread across 100s of volumes
	
	+ one aurora instance instance takes writes (master)
	+ automated failover for master in less than 30 secs
	+ master + up to 15 replicas read
	+ support for cross region replication

Aurora DB Cluster:
	+ One DNS name of master
	+ One DNS name of read replicas (load balance to all read replicas)
	+ Can define an custom endpoint that point into read replicas

Aurora Serverless: automated database instantiation and auto-scaling based on actual usage
			good for infrequent unpredicable workload
			no capacity planning needed
			pay per second

Global Aurora:
		+ Aurora Cross Region Read Replicas: like above mentioned
		+ Aurora Global Database: 
			- 1 primary region (read/write)
			- Up to 5 secondary (read-only) regions, replication lag < 1sec
			- Up to 16 Read Replicas per secondary regions
			- Promoting another region (for DR- Disaster Recovery) has an RTO (Recover Time Obj) < 1 min
