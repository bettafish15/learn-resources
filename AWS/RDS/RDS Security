RDS & Aurora Security:
	+ At-rest encryption:
		- database & replicas encryption using AWS KMS - defined at launch time
		- if master is not encrypted, the read replicas cannot be encrypted
		- to encrypt an un-encrypted database, go through a db snapshot & restore as encrypted

	+ In-flight encryption:
		- TLS-ready by default, must use an AWS TLS root cert at client-side

	+ IAM Authentication: IAM roles to connect to your database (instead of username/pass)

	+ Security groups: Control Network access to your RDS / Aurora DB

	+ No SSH available except RDS Custom

	+ Audit Logs can be enabled and sent to CloudWatch Logs for longer retention
