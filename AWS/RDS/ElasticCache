ElasticCache:
	- Managed Redis/Memcached
	- AWS takes care of OS maintenance/patching, optimizations, setup, config, monitor, failure recovery/backups
	- need to change app code

ElasticCache - Redis vs Memcached
	- Redis:
		+ Multi AZ with auto-failover
		+ Read Replicas to scale reads => high avail
		+ data durability using AOF (Append Only File) persistence
		+ backup/restore features
		+ supports sets/sorted sets (feature of Redis)

	- Memcache:
		+ multi-node for partition of data (sharding)
		+ no high avail (replication)
		+ non persistent
		+ no backup and restore
		+ multi-threaded arch



RDB (Redis Database): RDB persistence performs point-in-time snapshots of your dataset at specified intervals.
vs
AOF (Append Only File): AOF persistence logs every write operation received by the server. 
These operations can then be replayed again at server startup, reconstructing the original dataset. 
Commands are logged using the same format as the Redis protocol itself.

A Redis sorted set is a collection of unique strings (members) ordered by an associated score
A Redis set is an unordered collection of unique strings (members)
